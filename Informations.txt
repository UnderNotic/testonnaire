Supported browsers

Directives from this repository are automatically tested with the following browsers:

    Chrome (stable and canary channel)
    Firefox
    IE 9 and 10
    Opera
    Safari

Modern mobile browsers should work without problems.

IE 8 is not officially supported at the moment. This project is run by volunteers and with the current number of commiters we are not in the position to guarantee IE8 support. If you need support for IE8 we would welcome a contributor who would like to take care about IE8. Alternatively you could sponsor this project to guarantee IE8 support.
